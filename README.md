### Description
This project is dynamic full-stack web application that displays the complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) set of operations. It is a Community-based diving site with many features for users (which can either register and become creators, or simply view the content) to share experiences with one another about the their dives, locations, and overall diving experiences. What sets a part this website, is the ability to specifically focus in diving-related sharing of information with fellow divers and onlookers (potential future divers!).

### Main Reason To Build This Website
Although there are some groups and other website that have diving as an "interest", there is a need for comprehensive and social-media-esque page that integrates the complexities, equipment, and detailed stories. In this website, a registered user is able to post a log about their diving adventures all around the world, and other members of the community can comment on either their experience, or simply on the location of the diving site. This allows for the community to grow their collective diving feats and the number of locations. Overall, the Deeper Dive site is an exciting and welcoming place for anybody to view and/or post about their diving passion. Having a common-place (Deep Dive website) for fellow divers creates a strong bond and enhaces the overall experience.
