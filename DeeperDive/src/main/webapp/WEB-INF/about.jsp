<h2>About Us</h2>

<h3>Deeper Dive Community and Staff</h3>


<p>Although there are other diving online groups and websites that have diving as an "interest", we feel that there is 
a need for comprehensive and community-based page that integrates the complexities, peculiarities, and details that seem 
absent on the other sites.</p>

<p>
Deeper Dive motivates its registered users to feel comfortable and to post their experiences about their diving adventures 
all around the world, and our non-registered (...future) members of the community can comment on either those experiences, or simply on 
the location of the diving site. This allows for the Deeper Dive community to grow on our members collective diving 
feats and the number of locations.</p> 


<p>Overall, the Deeper Dive site is an exciting and welcoming place for anybody to view and/or post about their diving passion. 
Having a common-place (Deep Dive website) for fellow divers creates a strong bond and enhances the overall experience.</p>
